## ABSTRACT

### Context: 
Open Source has gained enough traction in the business world
to be perceived as a potential source of competitive advantage.
Objective: This document proposes a process that progressively allows
an organization to move towards the implementation of an Open Source
contribution model to cultivate its benefits in favor of a project
(product, service, component, etc).

### Method: 
On February 14, 2024, the Gimbalabs community initiated a
process of ideation and implementation of a Governance framework,
which has been recorded through a series of sessions called “Gimbalabs
Open Spaces” that are still ongoing to date, to build in public and
creating an entry point for new contributors. The procedure described
in section 3. Research Design of this study and its findings are the
product of the running of these governance sessions.

### Results: 
The “Open Source Contribution Model for Cardano
Organizations” formulated in section 4. Results, describes a structure
of access layers for users and contributors to a project that an
organization has decided to make open participation in an Open Source
framework. In addition to being access points, these layers allow to
conceive the organic growth of a community of contributors that
influences and guides the transformation of the organization itself.

### Conclusion: 
Establishing open source participation and governance
structures drastically redefines the management style of an
organization. A drastic change in exchange of extracting the proven
benefits of the value proposition of open source models. Slowly
embarking on the implementation of such models while the
organization's learning curve gains momentum is the most appropriate
approach to follow.
